Yes, most company handbooks and employee manuals are boring and uninformative. This book is different. This book lays out all the key ingredients that define our special company culture. Some of those may be familiar to you. But a lot of them will be new to you or different from previous places you have worked.

We care deeply about how we work together - not just the results we produce. How we work together is explained in this book. The book lays out the principles that build the foundation we all stand on to produce amazing work as one team.

That is why we are asking you to read this book. With a pretty-please. It’s that important. Make yourself a nice cup of coffee, tea, or beverage of your choice, find yourself a comfortable chair and have a read.

Oh, and keep the book close. There is a lot of content in here, so don’t worry if you won’t remember it all. We wrote it all down, so you can go back to the book whenever you need to.

We all own our culture and how we work together. If you think something is missing, incomplete, or wrong, please [open an issue or submit a pull request](https://github.com/DataSQRL/company-docs/issues). This is a living book and we actively collaborate on culture to make this the most fulfilling place to work. What you are reading right now is compiled from our past experiences working for and building companies and our desire to build a safe, enjoyable, and high-performance organization that we want to dedicate our working hours to. If you find anything in this book confusing or have questions, please [let us know](/contact).

## What’s In This Book?

This book defines the [mission & vision](/docs/mission) for DataSQRL. It discusses [why you](/docs/you) are such an important part of our company, what you bring to the company, and how DataSQRL supports your growth. In addition, this book outlines the [culture](/docs/culture) and [key processes](/docs/process) at DataSQRL.

[Culture](/docs/culture) is defined by our core values and associated behaviors. Our culture, values, and behaviors determine how we work together to achieve outstanding results. We deeply care about our culture because our culture builds the foundation we share to effectively communicate, collaborate, and execute. Our culture is the operating system of our company.

Our culture is defined by these core values:

* Belonging
* Resourcefulness
* Responsibility

For tasks that we frequently have to accomplish, we use a set of [shared processes](/docs/process) to simplify, streamline, and expedite the execution of those tasks. Processes take the guesswork out of “How should we do this thing?”. Having a shared set of processes we all rely on to accomplish those things ensures that we are all aligned, achieve consistent results, and preserve energy. While culture is the operating system of our company, processes are the apps we all use.
