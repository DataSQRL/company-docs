# Culture in Practice

Puh, that was a lot to read on DataSQRL's culture. We put a lot of thought into it because we believe that culture is really important. But what does culture mean for the day-to-day reality of working at DataSQRL? How do the values manifest in how we act?

Here are some examples and suggestions for how to live our culture.

**Belonging:**
* We make an effort to bring people in, provide context, and open space for constructive conversations.
* We extend smart trust, assume the best intentions, and try to understand before we judge.
* We use active listening and non-violent communication.
* If we feel unsafe or disrespected, we excuse ourselves from the situation, evaluate, and seek help.
* We are self-aware and take responsibility for our emotions. We invest into our emotional resilience to avoid outsourcing negative emotions to others.

**Resourcefulness:**
* We invite ideas - even the crazy ones - to explore the space of possibilities. We evaluate and judge ideas, not the people behind them.
* We prefer lean execution and getting things done over complete or comprehensive solutions to get feedback quickly and iterate.
* We balance quality with efficient execution and own the tradeoff.

**Responsibility:**
* We clearly articulate and write down our plans and commitments and share those freely with the company.
* We hold each other accountable for our commitments and actions without attacking the person.
* We assume responsibility in everything we do and embrace failure when we fall short. We are here to learn and grow, and not to protect our egos.
