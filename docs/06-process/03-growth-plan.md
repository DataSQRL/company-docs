At DataSQRL, we are deeply committed to your personal growth, well-being, and success. We want to provide the environment and support you need to perform and grow. One way we support your personal growth is through the [growth plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18harro1QmSleg5AljxWYhp7ChZrzeuXH2qexuSZcqPY).

Every year, you work with your mentor to develop a personalized growth plan that spells out in detail where and how you want to grow at DataSQRL. It also includes the specific investments that DataSQRL will make in your personal growth, such as trainings, skill oriented projects, conference attendance, etc.

The growth plan is how we hold ourselves accountable to your personal growth.
