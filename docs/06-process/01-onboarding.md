Here are steps to get you connected to all the people and systems you need to work at DataSQRL. Onboarding to a new company can be stressful and overwhelming. Lots of documents to read, language to absorb, people to meet, etc. Take it one step at a time. And if you are getting lost in the jungle, reach out to your mentor immediately. Don't struggle your way through.

1. Connect with your mentor if you haven't already. They will be your guide through the onboarding process. If you have any questions or issues, reach out to them.
1. Access your DataSQRL Google/Gmail account to view your emails and internal documents. You should have received your DataSQRL Google account credentials on your first day to your personal email (i.e. the email you used when applying and communicating with us).
1. Make a copy of the [onboarding checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AT0A1_coij83aJvUYDdEMbIWktTUahviy6y2WktHgik) and tick items off the list as you work through them.
1. Once you are all setup, work with your mentor on your first [growth plan](../growth-plan).
