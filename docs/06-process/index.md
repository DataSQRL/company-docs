# How We Work

:::note
This part of the company handbook mostly contains drafts since the company is still young.
Please contribute and help us refine our processes to make them work.
:::

For tasks that we frequently have to accomplish, we use these processes to simplify, streamline, and expedite the execution of those tasks. Processes take the guesswork out of “How should we do this thing?”. Having a shared set of processes we all rely on to accomplish those things ensures that we are all aligned, achieve consistent results, and preserve energy.

Don't worry, you don't have to read all the processes ahead of time. Just make a mental note that they are documented here and return whenever you need them.
