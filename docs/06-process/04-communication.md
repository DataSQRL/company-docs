# Communication

DataSQRL is a distributed company which makes it important to put things in writing. We don't have the proverbial "water cooler" to exchange information and [meetings](../meetings) are an ineffective tool for communication.

That's why we try to write important information and [decisions](../decision-making) down, so we can disseminate the information and revisit it whenever we need to.

Writing things down also clarifies thinking. When we put our thoughts on paper we can more readily identify weaknesses in our argument or omissions.

The long and short of it is this: If it's not in writing, it doesn't exist. Make sure you write things down and store them in a place where people can find your documents.

Try to write in a clear, concise language. Don't worry about your style, spelling, or grammar. We don't expect you to be Mark Twain and there are great tools to help with the latter.
