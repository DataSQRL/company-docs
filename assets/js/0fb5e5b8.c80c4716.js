Taking well calculated risks is vital to breakthroughs. But when you take a risk, you may fail. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be a risk. And failing sucks. It sucks less when others support you in failure and help you get back on your feet with encouragement and empathy. It sucks unbearably when you get punished for such failures. When you punish failures, people will stop taking risks. In addition, you set the unrealistic expectation that one should be able to control an outcome which is impossible in an unpredictable world that changes frequently.\nThat\u2019s why psychological safety is important. We recognize that failure is inevitable and build emotional safety to catch people when they fail. We encourage thoughtful and measured risk-taking.
