We try to extend empathy in situations that are particularly challenging. For instance, when we are on the receiving end of an emotional outburst, we try not to withdraw into our shells but instead make ourselves vulnerable in order to help the other person relieve their pain.\nIn short, empathy means that we take good care of each other to create a safe environment where we feel comfortable to be vulnerable.
