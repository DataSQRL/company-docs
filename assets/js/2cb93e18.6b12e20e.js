That\u2019s why we are asking everyone to periodically reflect on your behaviors and actions to investigate how you are living our culture."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Our culture is anchored on our three core values: belonging, resourcefulness, and responsibility.

Each of those words was explained with more flowery words. Everybody nods - yes, those are nice words. People are asked to act in alignment with those words because those are the company values.

Every day you are making lots and lots of decisions - from the mundane to the highly complex. Those decisions drive how you act and behave. We would like you to use those core values in evaluating your decision choices. Instead of thinking of core values as virtue signals, we think of core values as tradeoffs we collectively make as a company. In other words, we all agree to prefer those choices that are most aligned with our core values over other choices. In doing so, we can act in concert and synchronicity without requiring central coordination."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"In practice, it looks like this.

For instance, we may delay an urgently needed hire in order to find a candidate that increases belonging. Or we may pass on a popular, well-established solution in favor of a more resourceful one. Core values are fundamentally about tradeoffs and adjusting our decision making to prefer those outcomes that are more aligned with our values."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Obviously, we are a business and as such we need to make decisions that advance our mission and success as a business. Choices that accomplish this are reasonable choices. Of those reasonable choices, we aim to pick the ones that are most aligned with our core values. Sometimes you may find yourself in a situation where our core values stand in conflict with business objectives like maximizing revenue, acquiring customers, or reducing costs. Those are the most challenging decisions and there is no perfect recipe for how to balance such a tradeoff. At DataSQRL we are willing to sacrifice short term business outcomes in favor of nurturing our company culture because we believe that company culture is more important to long term success. We encourage you to take a long term perspective in making such decisions and consult others if you are in doubt. We trust that you will make the right decision if you keep our core values in mind."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"In short, please incorporate our core values into your daily decision making, think of them as factors to score your decision choices, and prefer those choices which are more aligned with our core values even when there are reasonable choices that seem better in other regards.\nFor each of the core values we are going to give examples of tradeoffs to illustrate that last point."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
