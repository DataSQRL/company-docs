In general, emphasizing responsibility means that we choose to only work on a few things so we can fully commit to and own them. It means that we spend extra time defining our work and what we are going to do. To promote a culture of responsibility we try to use the tool of urgency sparingly. That means we try to use \u201cfire drills\u201d and \u201ccrunch mode\u201d sparingly where an overwhelming sense of urgency becomes the defining characteristic that drives all work.
